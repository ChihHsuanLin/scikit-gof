- Watson's test would just require coding the statistic calculation and tests;
- Code Ziggurat of Marsaglia for testsim, see doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08;
- Simard uses Pomeranz recursion as an alternative to Durbin matrix -- its up
  to 10x faster for small sample counts and statistic values above the mean;
- vect.varange() could support arrays of starts, ends, counts etc.;


+ More extensive tests for addist and cvmdist;
